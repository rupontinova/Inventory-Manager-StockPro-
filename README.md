# Inventory-Manager
This code is intended to perform various activity in an inventory, including product and workers
The code takes input of various product, their serial number, company name and details of workers
it can show all products in the inventory, checkout and check in products etc. 
The code does all these things in file system, and does not use any database system. 
All you need to do is download the code. Then create two txt file anywhere in your pc, names as product and inventory. Copy their path, go to the code, in every file directory, if the method is related to product then paste the product.txt directory, and for worker paste the worker.txt directory

this is my first year final project, we were not taught database so our instruction was to create this whole code using file system and array list.
